# meal-maker
With this code, you can make a meal for every day. It is an exercise from Codecademy to practice with getters and setters.

## part 2
The lesson behind this code was updated in 2022. I have made an older version in 2021 that looks similar like this code. Please look for meal-plan in my repositorys.
